pixel manipulation

This java based desktop application is an examplary application of image processing in computer science.
I completed this project in the fullfilment of my degree requirements. 
It is a very basic photo editing application developed using basic mathematical operation in (RGB) pixel values. 
The buttons and menu in the application are self explanatory.
I complied the code in Netbeans IDE v 8.0.2.

The code is not commented. :(
