pixel manipulation

This java based desktop application is a desktop application which implements the concept of image processing in computer science.
I completed this project for the fullfilment of my degree requirements. 
The program helps manipulate pictures using RGB values of the pixels.
The buttons and menu in the application are self explanatory.
I complied the code in Netbeans IDE v 8.0.2.

The code is not commented. :(
